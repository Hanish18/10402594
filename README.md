DATASET DESCRIPTION:
The ReefBase Coral Bleaching dataset provides observation details of coral bleaching
occurrences (or lack thereof) around the world. This dataset was build upon an original
bleaching database developed at UNEP-WCMC, and has been maintained and updated
regularly by ReefBase since early 2002. Main sources of information for this dataset
have been: published records from the literature, postings on the coral-list
(http://www.coral.noaa.gov/lists/), the ReefBase online Bleaching Report
(http://www.reefbase.org/contribute/bleachingreport.aspx), and through collaborations
with numerous institutions and individuals. ReefBase would like to particularly acknowledge
the contributions made by: National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority .
