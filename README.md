DATASET DESCRIPTION:
The ReefBase Coral Bleaching dataset provides observation details of coral bleaching
occurrences (or lack thereof) around the world. This dataset was build upon an original
bleaching database developed at UNEP-WCMC, and has been maintained and updated
regularly by ReefBase since early 2002. Main sources of information for this dataset
have been: published records from the literature, postings on the coral-list
(http://www.coral.noaa.gov/lists/), the ReefBase online Bleaching Report
(http://www.reefbase.org/contribute/bleachingreport.aspx), and through collaborations
with numerous institutions and individuals. ReefBase would like to particularly acknowledge
the contributions made by: National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority .

The graph describes the formation of coral bleeching from years 1997 to 2010 in Australia. It was observed that the count of corals was around 25 in 1997 and then it was reduced in years between 2000 to 2002 and then it again raised and reached to peak in 2006 and then formation of corals has again  decreased.

The map describes the formation of corals in different parts of Australia.
